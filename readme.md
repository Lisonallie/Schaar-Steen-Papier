### Rock Paper Scissors

##### Why did I make this game? 🗿🗿🗿
This game was assigned to me as an exercise to learn JavaScript. 

##### What were the learning objectives? 📃📃📃
The learning objectives were to learn how to use random in js and generate if statements. I also learned how to use the switch method with cases and how to use a function to capitalize instances of words and replace them in functions.

##### How did I make the game? ✂️✂️✂️
I followed a nifty tutorial on youtube that showed me how to set up the initial functions I needed. I set the default text and the text for choices of rock, paper, and scissors. I set up a switch statment with different cases to determine who won.

##### How does the game look and work? 🖥️🖥️🖥️
In terms of CSS, I set up the 3 choices as buttons in a row with a icon of rock paper and scissors inside each respectively, and a reset button underneath. The user clicks on either rock, paper, or scissors and the innerHTML of the welcome message changes based on who won.
